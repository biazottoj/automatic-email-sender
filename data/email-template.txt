Dear $name,

My name is Darius. I'm a Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at the University of Groningen (the Netherlands).
For my research, I'm investigating architectural issues in open source projects and currently interviewing open source developers about the effort spent maintaining such projects.
Looking at your GitHub account, it seems that you are quite an active developer for the $project project, therefore you would be a perfect candidate for our interviews!
Would you be interested to participate? The interview will be held over Google Meet (or your preferred software) and will last around 30 minutes.
I want to stress that the interview is informal and strictly confidential.

During the interview, I will ask you a few questions to know your professional opinion on Technical Debt, Maintainability and the results I obtained analysing $project with our own tool.

These interviews are instrumental for my research, and I would greatly appreciate you finding some time for me.
I'm looking forward to receiving your reply and scheduling the interview.
Please let me know in what time zone do you live and feel free to suggest a time slot of when you are available.

Thank you!

Best Regards,
Darius Sas
